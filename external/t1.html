      <b>Machine learning (ML) is an umbrella term for solving problems for which
        development of algorithms by human programmers</b> would be cost-prohibitive,
      and instead the problems are solved by helping machines "discover" their
      "own" algorithms, without needing to be explicitly told what to do by
      any human-developed algorithms.[2] Recently, generative artificial neural
      networks have been able to surpass results of many previous
      approaches. Machine-learning approaches have been applied to large
      language models, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering,
      agriculture and medicine, where it is too costly to develop algorithms to
      perform the needed tasks. The mathematical foundations of ML are
      provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods.
      Data mining is a related (parallel) field of study, focusing on
      exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.ML is known
      in its application across business problems under the name predictive
      analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically based,
      computational statistics is an important source of the field's methods.
