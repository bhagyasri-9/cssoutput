      <b>Deep learning</b> is part of a broader family of machine learning methods,
      which is based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.
      The adjective <ins>"deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers
        in the network. Methods used can be either supervised, semi-supervised or
        unsupervised.</ins> Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks,
      deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural
      networks, convolutional neural networks and transformers have been applied
      to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language
      processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical
      image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game
      programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases
      surpassing human expert performance. Artificial neural networks
      (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed
      communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences
      from biological brains. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend to
      be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living
      organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog.
