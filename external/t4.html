      <b>Automation describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human
        intervention in processes, namely by predetermining decision criteria,
        subprocess relationships, and related actions, as well as embodying those
        predeterminations in machines. </b>Automation has been achieved by
      various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical,
      electronic devices, and computers, usually in combination. Complicated
      systems, such as modern factories, airplanes, and ships typically use
      combinations of all of these techniques. The benefit of automation
      includes labor savings, reducing waste, savings in electricity costs,
      savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and
      precision. Automation includes the use of various equipment and control
      systems such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, and
      heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, and
      stabilization of ships, aircraft, and other applications and vehicles with
      reduced human intervention.Examples range from a household thermostat
      controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of
      thousands of input measurements and output control signals. Automation has
      also found a home in the banking industry. It can range from simple on-off
      control to multi-variable high-level algorithms in terms of control
      complexity.
